# 💫 About Me:

## Hello, I'm Cahyadi Prasetyo

👋 A passionate student at Universitas Maritim Raja Ali Haji (UMRAH), with a strong interest in technology, programming, and mentoring. My background in Software Engineering from SMKN 1 Bintan Timur has provided me with a solid foundation in software development, web programming, UI/UX design, database systems, and UML modeling for system architecture.

### 🔍 What I'm Looking For:
- 👯 Collaborating on Web Development, UI/UX projects, and Database Management.
- 🌱 Currently learning Full-Stack Development, API Integrations, and Cloud Computing.

### 💬 More About Me:
I have worked on various application development projects, both individually and in teams, focusing on innovative and efficient solutions. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading comics as a way to relax and explore new stories. I'm also passionate about motorcycle modifications—because, to me, redesigning engines and writing code share the same challenges: precision, problem-solving, and creativity.
